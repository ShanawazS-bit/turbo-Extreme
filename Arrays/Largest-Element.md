# My DSA Journey

## Purpose
This repo is my personal documentation of DSA problems, solutions, and insights.  
Goal: In the future, I can revisit my solutions, understand my thought process, and track progress, Learn Along!!.

```markdown
## Problem
- Name:
- Platform / Source:
- Link: https://takeuforward.org/plus/dsa/problems/largest-element

## Key Idea
(One sentence describing the core insight)

assume the largest is fist index then compare for each and change the max variable for that 
## Invariant
(The rule that must hold true during solution)

## Common Trap
(Mistakes I made or almost made)
for vectors its vector.size() 

## Solution
(Code    snippet here, clean and commented)
in .cpp

## Recode Check
- [ Y ] Can I re- code this in < 20 minutes? Y/N definitely
