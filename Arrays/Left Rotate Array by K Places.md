# My DSA Journey

## Purpose
This repo is my personal documentation of DSA problems, solutions, and insights.  
Goal: In the future, I can revisit my solutions, understand my thought process, and track progress, Learn Along!!.

```markdown
## Problem
- Name:
- Platform / Source:
- Link: hhttps://takeuforward.org/plus/dsa/problems/left-rotate-array

## Key Idea
(One sentence describing the core insight)

basiaclly dividing the array into 2 parts and storing the first part of array in temp and shiftin ghte rest by k places towards the left and the re insertin ghte temp array eleemnts at teh n-k+i position


## Invariant
(The rule that must hold true during solution)

## Common Trap
(Mistakes I made or almost made)
for vectors its vector.size() 
nums[nums.size()- 1] = last element
re pushing the elements in n-k + i place
also check divisor, if k > nums.size() then divide hence k %= n;



## Solution
(Code    snippet here , clean and commented)
in .cpp

## Recode Check
- [ Y ] Can I re-code this in < 20 minutes? Y/N
recoded for surity
